    question: Secretary Clinton, what do you think about Jeb Bush's comments about African-Americans and " free stuff" last week?
    answer: "That kind of rhetoric is deeply insulting, whether it comes from Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. I think people are seeing this for what it is: Republicans lecturing people of color instead of offering real solutions to help people get ahead, including facing up to hard truths about race and justice in America. Not to mention - Republicans have no problem promising tax breaks and sweetheart deals to their corporate friends, but when Democrats fight to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care, early childhood education, and job training, that's giving away \"free stuff\"?! Talk about backwards. And that’s not all. I’m calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration, criminal justice reforms, and protecting voting rights, but Republicans across the country are making it harder to vote. That’s wrong and it’s got to change. -H"

    question: Secretary Clinton, my question is in regards to Women's Health issues, what do you think about Republicans trying to shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood?
    answer: This really is outrageous. We’re talking about a women’s health organization that provides half a million breast exams every year. That’s what Republicans are going after. I’d like them to explain that to the mom who caught her cancer early thanks to a screening, or the teenager who avoided an unintended pregnancy because she had access to birth control, or the survivor of sexual assault who turned to Planned Parenthood for emergency contraception, STD testing, and support. These extreme views might be right for a Republican primary, but they’re dead wrong for America. -H

    question: Where do you keep your Grammy award?
    answer: Nick - it's on display in the Clinton Library in Little Rock, Arkansas! Hope you get to visit soon. -H

    question: How can a young person change the world?
    answer: I highly recommend you read my daughter's book, It's Your World! And I hope you join my campaign, so that we can make sure Republicans don't rip away the progress we've made over the past few years, on climate change, on LGBT issues, on saving the economy from trickle-down economics, on standing up for our values around the world, and so much more. Go to http://www.hillaryclinton.com/join to get involved. And even if you don't support me, I hope you vote and keep caring about the issues that matter to people's lives everywhere. -H

    question: "Future Madam President, How do you think campus police should handle sexual assaults on campus? I attend Lock Haven University, and not too long ago they adapted Title IX and even have an office for it. I just read our annual crime log report, and it said that 10 assaults happend on campus, in residential halls, in 2014. I believe it was 3 in 2013. The increase in these crimes astounds me. I guess my overall question is: what do you suggest we do, \"we\" as women?  Thanks, Heather Fallon"
    answer: It’s not enough to condemn sexual assault - we have to stop it. Sexual assault is a crime wherever it occurs. The stories are heartbreaking. Many survivors lack confidence in the criminal justice system because their complaints can be trivialized. We need to make sure that these complaints are taken seriously in the criminal justice system - for starters, let’s make sure we’re dedicating the proper resources to address the backlog of rape kits across the country. We need to create fairer processes not only in the criminal justice system but on college campuses. We need to make sure survivors have access to the critical, comprehensive, confidential services they need and deserve. -H</answer>

    question: My state, South Carolina, declined the expansion of Medicaid. That means that 200,000 people in my state still are without health coverage. What about people like them?
    answer: I think every one of those 200,000 people should be covered. The other day I was in both Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in a bipartisan compromise, and Louisiana, which refused. It was like a side-by-side live experiment - and the results are dramatic. Some 250,000 people in Arkansas got new access to health coverage, cutting the uninsured rate nearly in half. Fewer people without insurance leads to fewer emergency room visits and more prevention, which means lower costs and healthier people. Arkansas has already saved more than $30 million last year alone, and the state will save hundreds of millions more in the years to come. But in Louisiana, more than 190,000 people, most of them hard-working families trying to get ahead, were left with no health insurance. They saw none of those benefits. So I hope South Carolina and other states across the country look at the evidence and do the right thing. -H</answer>

    question: Hi Soon-to-Be President Clinton. Very excited for you to take office. It's been a long time coming. I'm curious to know - what's an issue you're passionate about that we don't hear much about via the media, debates, etc? Is there something close to your heart that you are excited to tackle?
    answer: Such a great question. There's early childhood education; better treatment and prevention of substance abuse; removing the stigma around mental health so people get the treatment they need; protecting voting rights; equal pay, which sometimes gets talked about but nothing ever seems to get done about; wage stagnation; and getting dark money out of politics. I wish there were more media coverage of issues like these that really go to the heart of our economy and our democracy. -H

    question: Hi. I really do not have a question for you this morning. Just want you to know you have my vote. Best to you!
    answer: Thanks so much for your support. I hope you'll reach out to everybody you know about why you're supporting me and how important this election is. -H

    question: Sec. Clinton, How much of a problem is the situation with Turing Pharmaceuticals and companies like it? Beyond the policy proposals you announced last week, how would your administration discourage what you called "price gouging"? Are you surprised that biotech stocks fell after your comments last week?
    answer: Hi Jen, thanks for your question. My plan actually encourages more investment in innovation and research, not less. So that should be a win-win for businesses and consumers. Bio-tech companies working on life-saving breakthroughs won't have anything to fear from my plan. But if you're price gouging American families and jacking up costs for no good reason, I'm going to hold you accountable. -H</answer>

    question: What about paid parental leave benefits for federal government employees?
    answer: I believe that every American should be guaranteed paid family leave. That guarantee is an important one--you shouldn't have to rely on winning the boss lottery to be able to care for your family. My Republican opponents don't believe this should be a promise that America makes to our families. For example, just last week, Senator Rubio offered a plan that would offer no guarantee and would do little to provide leave for those who don't already have it. As President, I would make guaranteed paid family leave a reality in the United States. -H

    question: Hi i'm supporting you as always my question is how can we get prescription drug cost down for everyone not just Medicare
    answer: Did you see the outcry last week about the former hedge fund manager who bought up drug patents, then raised the price of medicine for AIDS patients by more than 5000%? He still hasn’t said how much the drug will cost going forward, and in the meantime, sick patients still have to wait and worry and continue to pay $750/pill. So Mr. Shkreli, what’s it going to be? Do the right thing. Lower the cost today to its original price. There are other drug companies gouging Americans with higher prices than they charge other people around the world. We want to reward innovation, but right now consumers don't know if they are buying value or simply subsidizing high profits. That’s why I proposed a plan to make prescription drugs more affordable and hold companies accountable. Force drug manufacturers to justify their prices, make sure they add real value. Require the largest drug manufacturers to invest a minimum amount in R&D. And - a new idea to chew on - let's explore using some of these new research funds to invest directly in producing generic competitors where none exists. -H

    question: How can we make health insurance for many more affordable? I have friends who continue to complain as to how much they are required to pay in order to have health insurance. Everyone deserves the right to access healthcare at an affordable price.
    answer: Thanks for your question! The first thing we need to do is defend the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal it 54 times. 54 times! I am not going to let them kick 18 million people off their health coverage and force this country to start the health care debate all over again. We should build on the progress we’ve made, do more to bring down costs for families, including runaway prescription drug prices and out of pocket costs. I agree with you that too many Americans - who had good health insurance before ACA and still have it - are now facing higher and higher out of pocket costs. My plan will cap out of pocket prescription drug costs at $250/month to help people with chronic diseases and serious illnesses. I will also provide a tax credit of up to $5,000 for families with high out-of-pocket costs that aren’t covered by their insurance plans. Just last week, a study came out showing that Americans that the average deductible Americans with employer based coverage have to pay before their insurance kicks in has grown 7X faster than workers’ wages since 2010. That’s what I’ll do as President. -H
