  40 years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been
  ripped out.
  And I wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for
  his or her right to vote. For the grandmother who’s turned away from the polls because
  her driver’s license expired. For the father who’s done his time and paid his debt to
  society but still hasn’t gotten his rights back.
  Now we know, unfortunately, Barbara isn’t here to speak up for them and so many others.
  But we are. And we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what’s really going
  on in our country—because what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise
  people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other.
  Because since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in
  2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial
  discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.
  North Carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more
  convenient or more accessible. Early voting. Same-day registration. The ability of county
  election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.
  Now what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds
  and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?

  We should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy,
  not less.
  In fact I would say it is a cruel irony—but no coincidence—that Millennials, the most
  diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history, are now facing so much
  exclusion.

  And we need look no further than right here in Texas. You all know this far better than
  I, but if you want to vote in this state, you can use a concealed weapon permit as a
  valid form of identification—but a valid student ID isn’t good enough?
  Now, Krystal Watson found out the hard way. She grew up in Louisiana but came to Marshall,
  Texas, to attend Wiley College. Krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously
  that not only did she register to vote in Texas, where she was living and would be for
  a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well.
  But this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a Wiley College
  ID, she was turned away.

  Experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in Texas may face similar
  situations.

  And while high-profile state laws like those in Texas and North Carolina get most of the
  attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the
  radar. Like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates. Or scrap language assistance
  for non-English speakers—something Barbara Jordan fought so hard for.
  Without the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local
  community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge
  them and end them.

  It’s not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that
  minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls.
  They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting
  machines.

  In South Carolina, for example, there’s supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters.
  But in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. In Richland Country, nearly 90
  percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. Instead
  of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. Not
  surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays.

  Now there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all
  over this country. But this kind of disparity that I just mentioned does not happen by accident.
  Now some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas,
  of course I learned it from him. “You find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there
  on its own.” Well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident.
  And it is just wrong, it’s wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit Americans'
  rights to vote. Its counter to the values we share. And at a time when so many Americans
  have lost trust in our political system, it’s the opposite of what we should be doing in
  our country.

  This is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. We should be
  clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can
  imagine.

  Yet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions
  have undercut this fundamental American principle.

  Here in Texas, former Governor Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was
  actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. He applauded when
  the Voting Rights Act was gutted, and said the lost protections were “outdated and
  unnecessary.”

  But Governor Perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.
  In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would
  make it harder for college students to vote.

  In New Jersey, Governor Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.
  And in Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed
  purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.

  Thankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.
  So today, Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American
  citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?

  I believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can
  to make it easier for every citizen to vote.

  I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering
  about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they’re so scared
  of letting citizens have their say.

  Yes, this is about democracy. But it’s also about dignity. About the ability to stand
  up and say, yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts. And no matter where you come
  from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. In fact, it
  means a lot.

  I learned those lessons right here in Texas, registering voters in south Texas down in
  the valley in 1972.

  Some of the people I met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from Chicago who didn’t
  speak a word of Spanish. But they wanted to vote. They were citizens. They knew they had
  a right to be heard. They wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship
  conveys. That’s what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we're
  all the worse for it. It doesn’t just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens.

  It holds back our entire country.

  That’s why, as a Senator, I championed a bill called the Count Every Vote Act. If it
  had become law, it would have made Election Day a federal holiday and mandated early voting
  opportunities. Deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods
  with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. And many Americans
  with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten
  their voting rights back.

  Well today, with the damage to the Voting Rights Act so severe, the need for action
  is even more urgent.

  First, Congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore
  the full protections that American voters need and deserve.

  I was in the Senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the Voting Rights
  Act after an exhaustive review process.

  There had been more than 20 hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Testimony
  from expert witnesses. Investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered
  jurisdictions. There were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. Now that is how
  the system is supposed to work. You gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide.
  And we did 98 to nothing. We put principle ahead of politics. That is what Congress needs
  to do again.

  Second, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission
  to improve voting. That commission was chaired by President Obama’s campaign lawyer and
  by Governor Mitt Romney campaign’s lawyer. And they actually agreed. And they set forth
  common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. Providing
  online voter registration. Establishing the principle that no one should ever have to
  wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote.

  Third, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person
  voting everywhere—including opportunities for weekend and evening voting. If families
  coming out of church on Sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free
  to do just that. And we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give
  more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations
  that make it difficult to get to the polls on Election Day.

  It’s not just convenient—it’s also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable
  than absentee voting. So let’s get this done.

  And I believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in America. So today
  I am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen, every state in
  the Union. Everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to
  vote when they turn 18—unless they actively choose to opt out. But I believe this would
  have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. Between a quarter and a third
  of all eligible Americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.

  And we should modernize our entire approach to registration. The current system is a relic
  from an earlier age. It relies on a blizzard of paper records and it’s full of errors.
  We can do better. We can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete.
  When you move, your registration should move with you. If you are an eligible vote and
  want to be registered, you should be a registered voter—period.

  Now, Oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should
  follow. The technology is there. States have a lot of the data already. It’s just a matter
  of syncing and streamlining.

  Now, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common
  sense ways to strengthen our democracy. But I’ll be candid here, none of them will come
  easily.

  It’s going to take leadership at many levels.

  Now more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want
  to hear what is on their minds.

  We need more activists working to expose abuses, educate Americans about their rights, and
  hold authorities accountable for protecting them. Some of the worst provisions in recent
  laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal
  challenges. But they can’t do it alone.

  We need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina
  to build momentum for reform.

  We need more Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen’s right to
  vote, I mean the principle underlying our Constitution, which we had to fight for a
  long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a Supreme Court
  that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy
  and election of a corporation.

  But of course, you know what we really need? We need more elected leaders from Houston
  to Austin to Washington who will follow in the footsteps of Barbara Jordan and fight
  for the rights and opportunities of everyday Americans, not just those at the top of the
  ladder. And we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.

  You know, when I traveled around the world as your Secretary of State, one of the most
  frequent questions I was asked was, "How could you and President Obama work together after
  you fought so hard in that campaign?"

  People were genuinely amazed, which I suppose is understandable, considering that in many
  places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned
  or exiled—even killed—not hired as Secretary of State.

  And it’s true, I was surprised when the President asked me to serve. But he made that
  offer, and I accepted it, because we both love our country.

  So my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that America was built by
  people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. They
  were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.

  As Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left
  most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed
  to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.

  And nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally
  passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.
  So that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights,
  not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation
  of leaders to slow or reverse America’s long march toward a more perfect union.
  We owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before
  us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly.
  And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.

  That’s what Barbara Jordan would do. That’s what we should do in honor of her.
  Thank you, and may God bless you.

  As Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left
  20:45
  most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed
  20:53
  to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.
  20:59
  And nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally
  21:05
  passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.
  21:14
  So that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights,
  21:28
  not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation
  21:37
  of leaders to slow or reverse America’s long march toward a more perfect union.
  21:43
  We owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before
  21:50
  us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly.
  21:57
  And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.
  22:03
  That’s what Barbara Jordan would do. That’s what we should do in honor of her.
  22:10
  Thank you, and may God bless you.
