  BAIER: Welcome to Ames, Iowa, on the campus of Iowa State University and the Republican
  presidential debate.

  Our event is being sponsored by Fox News and the Washington Examiner, in conjunction
  — in conjunction with the Iowa Republican Party. We're being seen, obviously, on
  Fox News Channel, being streamed on foxnews.com. You can log on and check out how
  you can react to our debate. We're also being heard on Fox News Radio.

  And these folks in the stadium — in the studio are just fired up, as you can hear.

  Okay ... now let's meet the candidates: former Senator Rick Santorum; businessman
  Herman Cain; Congressman Ron Paul; former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney; Congresswoman
  Michele Bachmann; former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty; former Utah Governor Jon
  Huntsman; and former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.

  Joining me at the desk tonight, my Fox News colleague and anchor of "Fox News Sunday,"
  Chris Wallace. And from the Washington Examiner, Byron York and Susan Ferrechio.

  We're gathered tonight at a very unsettling moment for Americans. We've watched
  the stock market on a wild rollercoaster ride this week, as people are anxiously
  tracking their balances and their retirement accounts and college funds. About 14
  million people don't have a job tonight, and millions more have given up looking
  or have taken part-time work to try to scrape by. The nation's credit rating was
  downgraded for the first time in history, as we try to get a handle on the country's
  skyrocketing debt. And just last weekend in Afghanistan, more American lives were
  lost than on any other day in this decade-long conflict.

  So tonight, we are respectfully asking you, the candidates, to try to put aside
  the talking points, to try to put aside the polished lines that get applause on
  the campaign trail here in Iowa and around the country, and to level with the American
  people, to speak from the heart about how you would navigate this country through
  the challenges America faces.

  So let's begin. Congresswoman Bachmann, you say you can turn the economy around
  within one quarter by cutting taxes, reducing spending, and repealing the health
  care law. In fact, this week you said, quote, "It isn't that difficult," and, quote,
  "Solutions aren't that tough to figure out."

  Isn't it unrealistic to suggest that something as massive and complex as the U.S.
  economy can rebound in just three months?

  BACHMANN: We can start to seek recovery within three months, not the whole recovery,
  but we can begin to see it, if we put into place what we know to be true. Number
  one, we should not have increased the debt ceiling. In the last two months, I was
  leading on the issue of not increasing the debt ceiling. That turned out to be the
  right answer.

  And this is part of the movement that we're seeing all across the country. I've
  been leading that movement. I've been giving it voice. And it's not just Republicans.
  It's disaffected Democrats. It's independents. It's libertarians all coming together,
  apolitical people, because two days from now, Bret, we get to send a message to
  Barack Obama. And the message is this: You are finished in 2012, and you will be
  a one-term president.

  BAIER: Governor Romney, Congresswoman Bachmann says she can start to turn the economy
  around in three months. How long would it take you?

  ROMNEY: Well, I'm not going to give you an exact time-frame, but I can tell you
  this, that if you spend your life in the private sector and you understand how jobs
  come and how they go, you understand that what President Obama has done is the exact
  opposite of what the economy needed to be done. Almost every action he took made
  it harder for entrepreneurs to build businesses, for banks to make loans, for businesses
  to hire, and to build more capital.

  What needs to be done — there are really seven things that come to mind. One is
  to make sure our corporate tax rates are competitive with other nations. Number
  two is to make sure that our regulations and bureaucracy works not just for the
  bureaucrats in Washington, but for the businesses that are trying to grow. Number
  three is to have trade policies that work for us, not just for our opponents. Number
  four is to have an energy policy that gets us energy secure. Number five is to have
  the rule of law. Six, great institutions that build human capital, because capitalism
  is also about people, not just capital and physical goods. And number seven is to
  have a government that doesn't spend more money than it takes in. And I'll do it.

  BAIER: You — Governor Romney, you mentioned leadership on the economy. You are the
  front-runner in this GOP field, yet when it came to weighing in on the debt ceiling
  deal in Congress, something that had a major impact on the economy, many on this
  stage say you were missing in action. Some columnists even said you were in the
  "Mittness Protection Program." Then just hours before the House voted, you released
  a statement saying you could not support the bill. Is that leadership?

  ROMNEY: You know, this is a critical issue, which is, how big is the government
  going to be? Back in the days of John F. Kennedy, the federal government took up,
  along with the state and local governments, 27 percent of the economy. Today, government
  consumes 37 percent of the economy. We're inches away from no longer having a free
  economy.

  And so this is a critical issue. And, therefore, well before the debate got pushed
  along, I signed a pledge saying I would not raise the debt ceiling unless we had
  "cut, cap and balance." And that is the view I took on June 30th, and I reiterated
  that throughout the process, and, frankly, all the way to the very end.

  BAIER:  Just so everyone knows, when candidates go over the allotted time, they've
  agreed to this system. That's what you hear, the bell. And we'll try to not ring
  the bell that much. It's not the doorbell.

  So to be clear — and just to be clear here — you echoed Congresswoman Bachmann and
  Congressman Paul in being against that final compromise deal. So to phrase it another
  way, if you were president, you would have vetoed that bill?

  ROMNEY: Look, I'm not going to eat Barack Obama's dog food, all right? What he served
  up was not what I would have done if I'd had been president of the United States.
  If — if I'd have — if I'd have been...

  BAIER: I know, but that bill was the deal on the table, Governor.

  ROMNEY: If I'd have been — well, I'm not — I'm not president now, though I'd like
  to have been. If I were president, what I would have done is cut federal spending,
  capped federal spending as a percentage of the total economy, and then worked for
  a balanced budget amendment. If we do that, then we can rein back the scale of government.
  And that's the right thing to do. And that's what I said is the — and June 30th.

  BAIER: OK. Congressman Paul, as you know, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the
  country's credit rating last week, one of the reasons S&P listed was because of
  partisan gridlock in Washington. Congressman, what specific things would you do
  as president to increase growth, calm the markets, create jobs that could pass through
  a divided Congress?

  PAUL: Well, they didn't downgrade it mainly because they couldn't come to a conclusion.
  They couldn't come to a conclusion because they didn't know what was going on. The
  country's bankrupt, and nobody wanted to admit it. And when you're bankrupt, you
  can't keep spending.

  And all these proposed cuts weren't cuts at all. What you have to do is restore
  sound money. You have to understand why you have a business cycle, why you have
  booms and busts. If you don't do that, there's no way you can solve these problems.

  And the booms and busts comes from a failed monetary system that — the interest
  rates that are way lower than — than they should be encourages malinvestment and
  debt. And to get out of that, all this other tinkering, you cannot do that unless
  you liquidate debt. You don't bail out the people that are bankrupt and dump the
  debt on the people. That is what's happened.

  So you have to allow liquidation of debt, eliminate the malinvestment. Then you
  go back and you can get growth again by having a better tax structure, lower taxes,
  invite capital back into this country, get a lot less regulations. And under those
  conditions, you can have growth again.

  BAIER: And you can get it through a divided Congress?

  PAUL: Well ... [Pause] The divided Congress will exist for a long time to come.
  Yes, you would have to get it through a — you'd have to get it through a divided
  Congress. But the one thing is, if you approach it constitutionally and if you approach
  it on the principles of liberty, you can bring people together.

  If we have to cut, maybe we wouldn't be so — so determined that you can't cut one
  nickel out of the militarism around the world. Neither the Democrats or the Republicans
  want to cut that. So if you want to cut, you have to put the militarism on the table,
  as well.

  BAIER: Mr. Cain — Mr. Cain, we — we know you have a four-point economic plan. But
  one specific thing, what one specific thing would President Cain do first to restart
  the economic engine? And, again, with the caveat: That one thing would have to get
  through a divided Congress.

  CAIN:  Make the tax rates permanent. That's one of — of the four-point plans, because
  the business sector is the economic engine. You have the group that's talking about
  spending. You have the group that's talking about cutting. I represent growth. And
  it starts with the business sector putting fuel in the engine.

  In addition to that one thing that you asked me to identify, we must have a maximum
  tax rate for corporations and individuals of 25 percent, take the capital gains
  tax rate to zero, take the tax on repatriated profits to zero, make them permanent,
  and — and then certainty back into this economy. And I believe we can turn it around.

  And one other thing. We don't have an option to wait longer than 90 days. It is
  imperative that we get this economy going in 90 days with the next president of
  the United States of America.

  BAIER: Governor Huntsman, you told the "New Hampshire Union Leader" recently you
  intend to convene a "council of business leaders" to figure without is needed to
  improve our economy.

  Governor, you have essentially been running for president for three months now.
  We checked your Web site. We were unable to find a detailed plan.

  In the middle of an economic crisis, shouldn't you already have a pretty detailed
  plan by now?

  HUNTSMAN: The plan you will find on our Web site, it is coming. We have been in
  the race only for a month and a half. But here's what I intend to do.

  I intend to do exactly what I did as governor of the state of Utah. We took a good
  state and we made it number one in this country in terms of job creation. If you
  want to know what I'm going to do, I'm going to do exactly what I did as governor.

  It's called leadership. It's called looking at how the free market system works.
  It's creating a competitive environment that speaks to growth.

  We cut taxes historically. We didn't just cut them, we cut them historically.

  We created the most business-friendly environment in the entire country. We were
  the best-managed state in the country. We maintained a AAA bond rating. All of the
  things this country so desperately needs.

  When you look at me and you ask, what is that guy going to do? Look at what I did
  as governor. That is exactly what I'm going to do, and it's exactly what this country
  needs right now.

  BAIER: Speaker Gingrich, some people on this stage have run big companies, some
  have turned around companies, some managed payrolls. What makes you more qualified
  than anyone else on this stage to create jobs and grow the economy?

  GINGRICH: You know, you've been asking about divided government. This coming Saturday
  is the 30th anniversary of Ronald Reagan signing the Kemp-Roth tax cut which was
  done with divided government. I was part of that effort in the House when the Democrats
  were in control.

  He did it by going to the American people with clarity, creating a sense of urgency,
  bringing pressure to bear on the Democratic congressmen, and building a bipartisan
  majority. That tax cut lead to seven years of growth, which in our current economy
  would be the equivalent of adding 25 million jobs, $4.4 trillion a year to the economy
  and $800 billion in new federal revenue.

  A decade later, as Speaker of the House, we had divided government. We negotiated
  with Bill Clinton. He vetoed welfare reform twice. We passed it three times. He
  signed it the third time, the largest entitlement reform of your lifetime.

  We passed the first tax cut in 16 years, the largest capital gains tax cut in history.
  Unemployment dropped to 4.2 percent. How would the country feel today at 4.2 percent
  unemployment?

  That's my credential.

  BAIER:  Governor Pawlenty, you say your economic plan with tax cuts and spending
  caps would grow the economy by an average rate of five percent a year for 10 years,
  a rate that have never been achieved in 10 years in a row.

  With the last two quarters averaging less than one percent growth — and even some
  Republican budget analysts, very skeptical, openly skeptical of that plan — is your
  proposal just pie in the sky?

  PAWLENTY: Well, the United States of America needs a growth target, and it needs
  to be an aggressive and bold growth target. I don't want the United States' growth
  target to be anemic or lag like Barack Obama's.

  So, is the bar high? Yes. But do we need that growth to get out of this hole? You
  bet. And I hope people will go to our Web site and read that whole plan, because
  it's the most specific, comprehensive plan of any candidate in this race.

  But, Bret, there's another question here. Where is Barack Obama on these issues?

  You can't find his plans on some of the most pressing financial issues of our country.
  For example, where is Barack Obama's plan on Social Security reform, Medicare reform,
  Medicaid reform? In fact, I'll offer a prize tonight to anybody in this auditorium
  or anyone watching on television: if you can find Barack Obama's specific plan on
  any of those items, I will come to your house and cook you dinner.

  [Laughter]

  [Applause]

  BAIER: What do you think of that?

  PAWLENTY: Or, if you prefer, I'll come to your house and mow your land. But in case
  Mitt wins, I'm limited to one acre. One acre.

  BAIER: Oh.

  [Laughter]

  BAIER: Governor any response?

  ROMNEY:  That's just fine.

  BAIER: OK. Senator Santorum, nothing about your lawn, but Governor Pawlenty says
  America can quickly grow five percent a year for 10 years, with the right mix of
  policies.

  Is he right?

  SANTORUM:  America has unbounded potential. And I think putting a limit on that
  potential, we've grown at faster rates than that.

  For me, it's been a focus on one thing as I've traveled to now 68 counties in the
  state of Iowa, 50 in the last 14 days, working and meeting with the people of Iowa.
  And I've been talking to them about what we're going to do to grow the manufacturing
  sector of this economy.

  When I grew up in Butler, Pennsylvania, a little steel town, 21 percent of the people
  of this country worked in manufacturing. It is now nine. If you want to know where
  the middle of America went, it went to China, it went to Malaysia, it went to Indonesia.
  We need to bring it back.

  I put together a four-point plan to do it, including energy — producing more energy,
  because of course manufacturers use more energy than just about everybody else in
  the business world. But the big thing I proposed is to take the corporate rate which
  makes us uncompetitive, particularly in exporting goods, take the corporate rate
  and cut it to zero for manufacturers.

  You want to create opportunity for businesses in manufacturing to grow, cut that
  tax to zero. Our jobs will come back.

  [Applause]

  BAIER:  Turning the economy around is the topic we've received the most e-mails,
  the most Facebook messages, the most tweets about. Of course, it's topping all of
  the polls. So finding specific solutions to the country's economic ills will be
  a recurring theme throughout the debate tonight.

  Now to my colleague Chris Wallace with the next round of questions.

  WALLACE: Thank you, Bret. Good evening candidates.

  Governor Pawlenty and Congresswoman Bachmann, as you both know there's an expression
  Minnesota nice. And some people believe that both of you have tested it in recent
  weeks.

  Governor Pawlenty, you say that Representative Bachmann has no accomplishments in
  congress. You have questioned her ability to serve as president because of her history
  of migraines. Question governor, is she unqualified or is she just beating you in
  the polls?

  PAWLENTY: Well, Chris to correct you, I have not questioned Congresswoman Bachmann's
  migraine headaches. I don't think that is an issue. The only headache I hear about
  on the campaign trail is the headache Barack Obama has given the people of this
  country with his lousy leadership and this lousy economy.

  [Applause]

  PAWLENTY: Now as to Congresswoman Bachmann's record. Look, she has done wonderful
  things in her life, absolutely wonderful things, but it is an indisputable fact
  that in congress her record of accomplishment and results is nonexistent. That's
  not going to be good enough for our candidate for president of the United States,
  that is not going to be good enough for the president of the United States to serve
  in that capacity. The American people are going to expect and demand more. And in
  fact we need somebody who can contrast with Barack Obama on results.

  If you go to my record in Minnesota you will see government spending went from historic
  highs to historic lows. We appointed conservative justices, transformed the court
  in a conservative direction, we did health care reform the right way — no mandates
  individually, no government take-overs and more. That's the kind of record we're
  going to need to contrast and beat Barack Obama.

  WALLACE:  Congresswoman Bachmann, I'm going to ask you in a moment your own question
  about Governor Pawlenty. But I want to give you an opportunity to respond to his
  comments. You have 30 seconds. One, that you have no record of accomplishments in
  congress, and two that there's something missing in your resume because you do not
  have executive experience.

  BACHMANN: Well, thank you for asking the question.

  I would say governor, when you were governor in Minnesota you implemented cap and
  trade in our state and you praised the unconstitutional individual mandates and
  called for requiring all people in our state to purchase health insurance that the
  government would mandate.

  Third, you said the era of small government was over. That sounds more like Barack
  Obama, if you ask me.

  During my time in...

  [Applause]

  BACHMANN:  ...during my time in the United States Congress I have fought all of
  these unconstitutional measures as well as Barack Obama. And I led against increasing
  the debt ceiling the last two months.

  WALLACE: I just wanted to pick up, and in fact you anticipated the question I was
  going to ask you. And then I'm going to give you a chance to respond, governor.

  Congresswoman Bachmann, isn't that about the worst thing you can say about a fellow
  Republican in this campaign, that he reminds you of Barack Obama?

  BACHMANN: The policies that the governor advocated for were cap and trade. He praised
  and wanted to require Minnesotans to purchase the unconstitutional individual mandate
  in health care. And he said the era of small government is over. I have a very consistent
  record of fighting very hard against Barack Obama and his unconstitutional measures
  in congress. I'm very proud of that record. That is what qualifies me, as a fighter
  and representative of the people, to go to Washington, D.C. and to the White House.

  People are looking for a champion. They want someone who has been fighting. When
  it came to health care, I brought tens of thousands of Americans to Washington to
  fight the unconstitutional individual mandates. I didn't praise it. When it came
  to cap and trade, I fought it with everything that was in me, including I introduced
  the Lightbulb Freedom of Choice Act so people could all purchase the lightbulb of
  their choice.

  I also believe in big government is hurting the United States. We need to have small
  government.

  WALLACE: And I'm sure you have been waiting for the opportunity. Governor Pawlenty,
  30 seconds to respond.

  PAWLENTY: Well, I'm really surprised that Congresswoman Bachmann would say those
  things. That's not the kinds of things she said when I was governor of the state
  of Minnesota. And moreover, she's got a record of misstating and making false statements.
  And that's another example of that list.

  She says that she's fighting for these things. She fought for less government spending,
  we got a lot more. She led the effort against ObamaCare, we got ObamaCare. She led
  the effort against TARP, we got TARP. She said she's got a titanium spine. It's
  not her spine we're worried about, it's her record of results.

  If that's your view of effective leadership with results, please stop, because you're
  killing us.

  WALLACE: I...

  [Murmurs from audience]

  WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

  [Murmurs from audience]

  WALLACE: Congresswoman Bachmann, 30 seconds to response.

  BACHMANN: Thank you so much. I was at the tip of the spear fighting against the
  implementation of ObamaCare in the United States Congress. Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid
  and Barack Obama ran Congress, but I gave them a run for their money.

  Again, on cap and trade, I was there from the very beginning, giving Speaker Pelosi
  a run for her money. That's why I was Speaker Pelosi about her number one target
  to defeat last year, because I was effectively taking them on on nearly every argument
  they put forward.

  I fought...

  [Bell sounds]

  BACHMANN:  — when others ran, I fought. And I led against increasing the deficit.

  [Murmurs from audience]

  WALLACE: OK, let's — let's move to our panelists, if we could, so we can get more
  questions in.

  Thank you.

  WALLACE:  I — I see six other candidates there. I'm going to go to Governor Romney.

  You're campaigning as the man who can fix the economy. Let's look at your record,
  sir.

  As head of Bain Capital, you acquired American Pad & Paper. Two U.S. plants were
  closed and 385 jobs were cut. Later, you bought Dade International. Almost 2,000
  workers were laid off or relocated. And when you were governor, Massachusetts ranked
  47th of the 50 states in job growth.

  Question, you are going to be the jobs president?

  ROMNEY: Absolutely, Chris.

  Let me — let me tell you how the real economy works.

  When I was at Bain Capital, we invested in about 100 different companies. Not all
  of them worked. I know there are some people in Washington that doesn't understand
  how the free economy works. They think if you invest in a business, it's always
  going to go well. And they don't always go well.

  But I'm very proud of the fact that I learned about how you can be successful with
  an enterprise, why we lose jobs, how we gain jobs and overall, in those 100 businesses
  we invested in, tens of thousands of jobs, net-net, were created.

  I understand how the economy works. Herman Cain and I are the two on the stage here
  who've actually worked in the real economy. If people want to send to Washington
  someone who spent their entire career in government, they can choose a lot of folks.
  But if they want to choose somebody who understands how the private sector works,
  they're going to have to choose one of us, because we've been in it during our career.

  And, by the way, as the governor of Massachusetts, when I came in, jobs were being
  lost month after month after month. We turned that around. We were able to add jobs,
  balance our budget and get Massachusetts back on track. And, by the way, our unemployment
  was below the federal level three of the four years I was in office.

  BAIER: Chris will continue his round of questions on this round.

  And coming up, the issue of illegal immigration, the battle over health care.

  Please go to FoxNews.com/politics to check out the live blogging on tonight's debate.

  We'll be right back from Ames, Iowa after a short break.

  BAIER: Welcome back to the Stephens Auditorium on the campus of Iowa State University
  and the first Republican debate in the Hawkeye State. Now back to another fiery
  round of questions from Chris Wallace.

  WALLACE: Thank you.

  Speaker Gingrich, one of the ways that we judge a candidate is the campaign they
  run. In June, almost your entire national campaign staff resigned, along with your
  staff here in Iowa. They said that you were undisciplined in campaigning and fundraising,
  and at last report, you're a million dollars in debt. How do you respond to people
  who say that your campaign has been a mess so far?

  GINGRICH: Well, let me say, first of all, Chris, that I took seriously Bret's injunction
  to put aside the talking points, and I wish you would put aside the gotcha questions.

  [Applause]

  Like — like Ronald Reagan, who had 13 senior staff resign the morning of the New
  Hampshire primary and whose new campaign manager laid off 100 people because he
  had no money, because the consultants had spent it, like John McCain, who had to
  go and run an inexpensive campaign because the consultants spent it, I intend to
  run on ideas.

  Congress should come back Monday. They should repeal the Dodd-Frank bill. They should
  repeal Sarbanes-Oxley. They should repeal Obamacare. They should institute Lean
  Six Sigma across the entire federal government, a hard idea for Washington reporters
  to cover, but an important idea, because it's the key to American manufacturing
  success.

  GINGRICH: I'd love to see the rest of tonight's debate asking us about what we would
  do to lead an America whose president has failed to lead, instead of playing Mickey
  Mouse games.

  [Applause]

  WALLACE: Speaker Gingrich, if you think questions about your records are Mickey
  Mouse, I'm sorry. I think those are questions that a lot of people want to hear
  answers to, and you're responsible for your record, sir.

  [Booing]

  GINGRICH:  Well, if I get a rebuttal...

  WALLACE: Pardon?

  GINGRICH: I think that there's too much attention paid by the press corps about
  the campaign minutia and not enough paid by the press corps to the basic ideas that
  distinguish us from Barack Obama.

  [Applause]

  WALLACE: Governor Huntsman — Governor Huntsman, at the risk of raising Speaker Gingrich's
  ire, I'm going to ask you about your record, sir. You supported a stimulus package
  in 2009. In fact, you said the Obama stimulus package was not big enough. As governor,
  you signed onto a regional cap-and-trade market. You endorsed civil unions for same-sex
  couples. And you served as President Obama's ambassador to China. Some people have
  suggested that maybe you're running for president in the wrong party.

  HUNTSMAN: Chris, let me just say, I'm proud of my service to this country. If you
  love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, during a time of economic
  hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can
  actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going
  to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave.

  In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. And let me tell you what
  I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax
  cuts in the stimulus. We didn't have enough of it. And why did I talk about the
  need for tax cuts for business? Because we had done it in the state of Utah.

  We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly
  what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one
  job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs
  to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my
  record.

  WALLACE: Mr. Cain...

  [Applause]

  Mr. Cain, you have a compelling personal story and a strong record as a businessman,
  but you also have a growing list of questionable statements in this campaign, and
  I want to ask you about those, if I may, sir.

  You said that communities have the right to ban Muslims from building mosques, before
  you later apologized. You have stated that you do not have a firm plan yet as to
  what you would do in Afghanistan until you talk to the generals. You at one point
  in the campaign didn't know about the so-called Palestinian right of return during
  a big debate about the Mideast peace issues.

  How do you reassure people that you know enough to be president of the United States,
  sir?

  CAIN: You want me to answer all of those in one minute, Chris? Pick one.

  I know more about the Palestinian — the right of return issue now...

  [Crosstalk]

  CAIN: ... than I did then, and — but I know about it. I've been documented.

  The first point that you raised, about saying that communities have a right to ban
  mosques, no, that's not exactly what I said. Unfortunately, the people who helped
  you put that together have misquoted me. I have gone on record, and I put it in
  a press release that's available at my office that simply says that if anyone misunderstood
  my intent, I apologize for that. But never will I apologize for saying that Sharia
  law does not belong in the courts of the United States of America.

  Now, relative to Afghanistan...

  [Applause]

  Relative to Afghanistan, since we did this last, I have learned more about Afghanistan.
  And you may recall that one of the things that I always stress: Make sure you're
  working on the right problem. We don't have one problem in Afghanistan. We have
  three problems to deal with. I now have a better understanding of it. And if I get
  an opportunity to rebuttal, I'll tell you what those three are.

  [Laughter]

  WALLACE: You're going to get asked about Afghanistan, sir.

  Bret?

  BAIER: Now we turn to Susan Ferrechio with the Washington Examiner. She has the
  next round of questions for the candidates. The topic: illegal immigration. Susan?

  FERRECHIO: OK, we'll start with Governor Huntsman. You said that we need to bill
  a fence to secure our borders, but then we need to deal with the millions of illegal
  immigrants already here in the country. You said, quote, "There's got to be an alternative
  to sending them back. That's unrealistic."

  Governor Huntsman, are you proposing citizenship for illegal aliens?

  HUNTSMAN: Listen, I'm — I am a conservative problem-solver. I am pro-life, I'm pro-Second
  Amendment, I'm pro-growth on economics, and I'm here to tell you that, when elected
  president, the thing we need to do most on illegal immigration — because there has
  been zero leadership in Washington. And with zero leadership in Washington, we've
  created this patchwork of solutions in all — in a lot of the states, which makes
  for a very complex and confusing environment.

  When elected president, I'm simply going to prove to the American people that we
  can secure the border. That's what they want done. And I'm not going to talk about
  anything else until we get it done. Secure the border.

  Eighteen hundred miles, we've got a third of it done, between fencing and technology
  and National Guard boots on the ground. We can finish. And I will talk to the four
  border state governors and get verification from them that, in fact, we've secured
  the border.

  And once that is done, then we can move on. But this discussion has zero in the
  way of any intellectual credibility until such time as we secure the border.

  [Applause]

  FERRECHIO: OK.

  Governor Romney, turning to you, in 2008, you said you favored allowing American
  companies to hire more skilled foreign workers. With the unemployment rate now at
  9.1 percent, do you still think that employers need to import more foreign labor?

  ROMNEY: Well, of course not. We're not looking to bring people in and — in jobs
  that can be done by Americans. But at the same time, we want to make sure that America
  is a home and welcome to the best and brightest in the world.

  If someone comes here and gets a PhD in — in physics, that's the person I'd like
  to staple a green card to their — to their diploma, rather than saying to them to
  go home.

  Instead, we let people come across our border illegally or stay here and overstay
  their visa. They get to stay in the country. I want the best and brightest to be
  metered into the country based upon the needs of our employment sector and create
  jobs by bringing technology and innovation that comes from people around the world.

  Look, we — we are a nation of immigrants. We love legal immigration. But for legal
  immigration to work, we have to secure the border, and we also have to crack down
  on employers that hire people who are here illegally.

  I like legal immigration. I'd have the number of visas that we give to people here
  that come here legally, determined in part by the needs of our employment community.
  But we have to secure our border and crack down on those that bring folks here and
  hire here illegally.

  FERRECHIO: OK.

  Turning to you now, Mr. Cain.

  When President Obama joked about protecting the borders with alligators and a moat,
  not only did you embrace the idea, you upped the ante with "a 20-foot barbed wire
  electrified fence."

  Were you serious?

  CAIN: America has got to learn how to take a joke.

  [Laughter]

  But let me — allow me to give you my real solution to the immigration problem. I
  happen to believe that is four problems.

  Yes, we must secure the border with whatever means necessary. Secondly, enforce
  the laws that are there. Thirdly, promote the path to citizenship that's already
  there.

  We have a path to citizenship for illegal aliens. It's called legal immigration.

  And then, fourth, I happen to agree with empowering the states and allow them to
  deal with that issue. If we work on the right problem, we will be able to solve
  it.

  And in the case of immigration, we've got four problems that we need to work on
  simultaneously. It turns out that America can be a nation with high fences and wide
  open doors. That's what built this nation. So we can have high fences and wide open
  doors, all at the same time.

  [Applause]

  FERRECHIO: All right. Thank you.

  Speaker Gingrich, you recently told Univision that you're looking at the idea of
  having citizen boards choose which illegal immigrants can stay in the country and
  which would have to go. Who decides the memberships of these boards, and how would
  they work?

  GINGRICH: I think it's very important to go back and look at how the Selective Service
  Commission worked in World War II, because it was local, practical decision-making,
  and people genuinely thought it was fair and it was reasonable. But let me go back
  to your earlier question to Herman.

  I thought the president's speech in El Paso where he talked about moats and alligators
  was the perfect symbol of his failure as a leader. He failed to get any immigration
  reform through when he controlled the Senate and he controlled us. He could ram
  through Obamacare, but he couldn't deal with immigration.

  Now he has the Republicans in the House in charge, and he descends to a level of
  attack which I think is very sad for a president of the United States on an issue
  like this. We ought to control the border. And I agree with Governor Huntsman, we
  can control the border.

  I would be prepared to take as many people from Homeland Security's bureaucracy
  in Washington and move them to Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, as are needed, to
  control the border.

  [Applause]

  GINGRICH:  We should have English as the official language of government. And we
  should have a method for distinguishing between people who have lived here a long
  time and people who have come very recently.

  FERRECHIO: OK.

  Congressman Paul, you are opposed to a system that requires employers to verify
  the immigration status of their workers. Why would you want to eliminate one more
  tool to help curb illegal immigration?

  PAUL: I don't like putting the burden on our businessmen to be the policemen. That
  means he has to be policing activity.

  And I also resent the fact that illegals come into this country, and they do have
  problems, but if a church helps them and feeds them, we don't blame the church,
  or at least we shouldn't in a free society. But I have a strong position on immigration.

  I don't think that we should give amnesty and they become voters. But I do think
  we should deal with our borders.

  But one way that I would suggest that we could do it is pay less attention to the
  borders between Afghanistan and Iraq and Pakistan and bring our troops home and
  deal with the border. But why do we pay more attention to the borders overseas and
  less attention to the borders here at home?

  We now have a mess on the borders, and it has a lot more to do with it than just
  immigration, because we're financing some of this militarism against the drug dealers
  on the borders right now to the tune of over $1 billion. And there is a mess down
  there, but it's much bigger than just the immigration problem.

  But I do not believe in giving entitlements to illegal immigrants at all. And there
  should be no mandates on the states to make them do it.

  [Applause]

  BAIER:  As I said, we'll be returning to topic number one, the economy, throughout
  the debate.

  Byron York has the next round of questions.

  YORK: Thank you, Bret.

  We're going to start with Governor Romney.

  Governor, in 2005, when you were the governor of Massachusetts, you successfully
  appealed to Standard & Poor's to upgrade your state's credit rating. You said you
  used a combination of spending cuts and new revenues to put Massachusetts on a more
  sound financial footing. You even approvingly cited a tax increase passed by the
  Democratic state legislature.

  Doesn't this show that sometimes raising taxes is necessary?

  ROMNEY: No. I don't believe in raising taxes. And as governor I cut taxes 19 times
  and didn't raise taxes. Let's step back and talk about the first part what you said.
  I was fortunate enough to be a governor that got an increase in the credit rating
  in my state. At the same time we got a president who got a decrease in the credit
  rating of our nation. And that's because our president simply doesn't understand
  how to lead and how to grow an economy.

  I was very proud of the fact that Republicans and Democrats worked together in Massachusetts
  to cut spending. I came in, we had a huge deficit. I went to the legislature and
  I said I want expanded powers to unilaterally be able to cut spending not just slow
  the rate of growth but to cut spending and they gave it to me and I did. We cut
  spending.

  Every single year I was governor we balanced the budget. And by the end of my term
  we had put in place over a two billion dollar rainy day fund. That kind of leadership
  is what allowed us to get a credit upgrade from Standard & Poor's. And that's the
  leadership we finally need in the White House.

  YORK:  We're going to go to Governor Pawlenty next. Governor you say you balanced
  every budget without tax increases as governor of Minnesota, but in 2005 you levied
  a new tax on cigarettes, which you called a health impact fee. You said you had
  to compromise with a Democratic legislature to to end government shutdown.

  But doesn't that show that when leaders are faced with big deficits, they sometimes
  have to raise taxes?

  PAWLENTY: No. As I said before, I have got the best record of financial management,
  or one of them, of any governor in the country. The CATO institute gave only four
  governors in America their highest grade, an "A" grade. I was one of those governors.
  The other aren't running. The other three aren't even thinking about running.

  As to the circumstance that you mentioned, I had the first government shutdown in
  150 years. We did put together a package, but I balanced the budget every time in
  Minnesota that I was governor. In fact, my last budget ended June 30 of this year
  with a surplus.

  I did agree to the cigarette fee. I regretted that. As it turns out the courts later
  held it to be a fee. But nonetheless, it was an increase in revenues. It turns out
  we had a new budget forecast a few months later. And we didn't even need it.

  But my record of leadership in Minnesota, cutting spending from historic highs to
  historic lows, balancing the budget every time, doing health care reform the right
  way. Again, stands in contrast to Barack Obama. He should cancel his Cape Cod vacation,
  call the congress back into session and get to work on this.

  Barack Obama is missing in action. He should have the kind of leadership I had when
  I was governor of the state.

  YORK: Thank you, governor. Next we're going to go to Representative Bachmann. This
  is a question also about that cigarette tax increase. You were in the Minnesota
  state legislature at the time. And you said you opposed the tax, but in the end,
  you voted for it. Now you promise never to raise taxes. Why would you compromise
  then, but not now?

  BACHMANN: That's right. I was very vocal against that tax. And I fought against
  that tax. The problem is, when the deal was put together, Governor Pawlenty cut
  a deal with the special interest groups and he put in the same bill, a vote to increase
  the cigarette tax as well as the vote that would take away protections from the
  unborn.

  And I made a decision, I believe in the sanctity of human life. And I believe you
  can get money wrong, but you can't get life wrong. And that's why I came down on
  that decision that I made.

  [Applause]

  YORK: Governor Pawlenty, do you have a response — 30 seconds — to that?

  PAWLENTY: Yeah, what is wrong in the answer is the answer. Congresswoman Bachmann
  didn't vote for that bill because of a stripping away of pro-life protection, she
  voted for it and is now creating that as the excuse.

  But nonetheless, she speaks of leading these efforts in Washington and Minnesota,
  leading and failing is not the objective. Leading and getting results is the objective.
  I've got the best record of results as any candidate in this race.

  YORK: All right. Thank you. We're going to go to Senator Santorum.

  OK, yes you can.

  BACHMANN: In the — this is exactly what I'm trying to illustrate. We need to have
  a president of the United States who stands firm on their convictions. This is what
  I have demonstrated for everyday that I have been in congress. I have a consistent
  record of standing on my convictions. I didn't cut deals with special interests
  where you put the pro-life issues together with tax increase issues. That's a fundamental.
  It's a nonnegotiable.

  And when we come to a nonnegotiable, we must stand. And I stand.

  [Applause]

  YORK: Governor we're going to come back around.

  PAWLENTY: Just very quickly.

  Her answer is illogical. Her answer is illogical. If there were two bad things in
  the bill — a tax increase and we're hypothetically stripping away pro-life protections,
  which we weren't, then it is a double reason to vote against it. She voted for it.

  BACHMANN: I need to respond to that.

  YORK: OK. We have other people here.

  BACHMANN: I need to respond to that, because — I need to respond to that.

  YORK: I understand.

  I understand. You have the next question. [speaking to Santorum]
