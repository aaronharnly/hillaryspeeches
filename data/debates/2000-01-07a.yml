title: Republican Candidates Debate in Columbia, South Carolina
raw-text: >-
  PARTICIPANTS:

  Gary Bauer (President, Family Research Council);

  Governor George W. Bush (TX);

  Steve Forbes (Businessperson);

  Senator Orrin Hatch (UT);

  Former Ambassador Alan Keyes;

  Senator John McCain (AZ)

  MODERATORS:

  Brian Williams, NBC News; and

  David Stanton, WIS-TV

  Williams: Good evening and welcome, on behalf of NBC News, MSNBC, and WIS TV in
  Columbia, South Carolina — a big night in a big state, considered politically the
  gateway to the American South for its presidential primary February 19th.

  Stanton: Next month South Carolinians will decide who they want to be the Republican
  nominee. And since 1980, the very first Republican primary here in South Carolina,
  won by Ronald Reagan, no Republican has won its party's nomination without first
  winning here in South Carolina.

  Williams: Tonight we are going to hear from all six men vying for the GOP nomination
  for president. Let's meet each one of them now. Alan Keyes, former assistant secretary
  of State and ambassador under Ronald Reagan. [applause] U.S. Senator John McCain
  from the state of Arizona. [applause and cheers] Former Reagan administration official
  Gary Bauer. [applause and cheers] The governor of the state of Texas, George W.
  Bush. [applause and cheers] Steve Forbes of the magazine of the same name. [applause
  and cheers] And from the state of Utah, U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch. [applause]

  Stanton: We had drawings to determine the order of the questions, and each candidate
  will have 45 seconds to answer most questions. And we begin with a question for
  each candidate, beginning with Ambassador Keyes. Ambassador Keyes, last night you
  asked where all the conservatives have gone. If you had a choice between eight more
  years of a Democratic president or eight years of a pro-choice Republican, which
  would you choose?

  Keyes: Well, frankly I don't think that has to be our choice, unless we make a terrible
  error in the Republican Party. I think we have to choose to stand forthrightly for
  the pro-life position. And if we do not, the party doesn't stand a chance of winning
  a victory in November — it will not happen. This party was born of principle. This
  party will die if it does not adhere to its Declaration principles. And I think
  that's very clear. I have said it. I know most of the people in this room and throughout
  the Republican Party and the country understand that. So your hypothetical is of
  no matter to me. We will not face that alternative. [applause and cheers]

  Williams: Ambassador Keyes, thank you. Next question to Senator McCain. Senator,
  I am reading from the Associated Press a few minutes ago this evening, and I read,
  in quotes, "Two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fundraiser for him, Senator
  John McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing them of being
  unfair toward the phone company." Senator, your letter went on to say that the letter
  was not meant to benefit any one single person. And you have said in your own defense
  that this is part of what is wrong with Washington. However, do you understand now
  the appearance here, and can you tell us here tonight is there anything else about
  the transportation you use, about the letters you have written, anything else that
  you know of that is about to come out?

  McCain: I have, first of all, no idea. But the fact is that again my job as chairman
  of the Committee of Commerce, Science and Transportation is to oversight bureaucracies
  that are supposed to be serving the people. The Federal Communications Commission
  has not been doing that. Of all the times when I have weighed in, I have asked them
  to do their duty and to expedite the procedures as they are laid out under the law
  and according to existing regulations. I will continue to do that job. And when
  a constituent, a person of mine who has trouble, or a citizen of this country who
  can't get a reaction or an answer from a bureaucracy that is paid for with their
  tax dollars, I believe that people like me should weigh in, particularly when it
  is my responsibility as the chairman of the committee. I fully understand —

  Williams: Time is up, senator. Thank you, sir.

  McCain: Thank you. [applause]

  Stanton: Ladies and gentlemen, again we would ask that you would hold your applause
  until the end of the debate so we will have more time for the questions with the
  candidates.

  Mr. Bauer, if someone in your family was raped and became pregnant and wanted an
  abortion, and after a discussion with you they were adamant in their decision to
  have an abortion, would you support that decision or would you try to prevent it?

  Bauer: This is a very basic question. If my daughter or somebody that I loved was
  raped, that would be the most horrible thing I could possibly imagine. But I would
  comfort her. I would pray with her. I would explain to her that she couldn't make
  right the terrible thing that had happened to her by taking the life of her innocent
  unborn child. [applause and cheers]

  But the most important thing, sir, is not what I would do under those circumstances
  but what I would do as president. And as president I would throw rapists in jail
  for a long time so America's women wouldn't have to worry about it. [applause]

  Stanton: Thank you, sir.

  Williams: Governor Bush, a few blocks from here on top of the State Capitol Building,
  the confederate flag flies with the state flag and the U.S. flag. [booing] It is,
  as you can here from the reaction of tonight's — [booing] — it is, as you can here
  from the reaction of tonight's crowd of 3,000 people from South Carolina, a hot
  button issue here. The question is: Does the flag offend you personally?

  Bush: The answer to your question is — and what you are trying to get me to do is
  to express the will of the people of South Carolina, is what you are trying to get
  me to do.

  Williams: No, I am asking you about your personal feelings.

  Bush: The people of South Carolina — [applause and cheers] — Brian, I believe the
  people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with this flag issue. It's the
  people of South Carolina's decision to make. [applause and cheers]

  Williams: If I may —

  Bush: I don't believe — I don't believe it's the role of someone from outside South
  Carolina and someone running for president to come into this state and tell the
  people of South Carolina what to do with their business when it comes to the flag.
  [applause and cheers]

  Williams: As an American citizen, do you have a visceral reaction to seeing the
  confederate flag? [booing]

  Bush: As an American citizen, I trust the people of South Carolina to make the decision
  for South Carolina. [applause and cheers]

  Stanton: Mr. Forbes has the next question. There are many people on fixed incomes
  with health problems. And by the time they say their medications have been paid
  for, they don't have money for food or clothing or other necessities. Do you think
  people like this need some help, and from what source should that help come?

  Forbes: Well, clearly millions of Americans need help on health care. The major
  reason why is they are not in charge of their health care — HMOs are, insurers are,
  government bureaucracies are. And that's not right. And that's why I proposed with
  Medicare that people on Medicare have the same kind of choice members of Congress
  and those who work for the federal government have being able to choose from several
  hundred different health care plans. And if you have a need for prescriptive medicines,
  you can pick a plan that will provide that need. If you have a need for long-term
  care, you can do the same thing. I want to give people choice, put health care back
  in the hands of the people, and I've got specific proposals to do it. [applause
  and cheers]

  Williams: Thank you, Mr. Forbes. Tonight we're also going to be taking some emails.
  This particular one comes into us from Carla Hardee of South Carolina: Forty, fifty,
  even sixty years ago, when a man entered the military he did so with commitment.
  Along with this he was promised commitment by the government. One of the promises
  made was medical for himself and his dependents. If elected, Senator Hatch, what
  would you do specifically to reinstitute the lifetime benefits veterans are entitled
  to by having placed their lives in the hands of the United States government? What
  attraction would you offer for new enlistees to encourage a stronger and more vital
  military presence?

  Hatch: Well, I'll tell you the first thing I'd do as president is I would make sure
  that a third of our military who qualify for food stamps start getting paid decently
  and honorably. [applause] Twelve thousand of them are on food stamps. It's terrible.
  And to make a long story short, we have to live up to our commitments to our military
  people. One of them was to provide health care for veterans. We have about 26 million
  veterans in this country. A very small percentage of those actually apply for this
  type of health care. But we have got to provide for it, and it seems to me we have
  got to make it the best possible health care we can.

  Stanton: We're also going to give the candidates a chance to ask each other questions
  tonight, and we begin with Mr. Forbes, who has a question for Mr. Bauer.

  Forbes: Gary, you have obviously read in the papers about a key official in the
  Gore campaign, Donna Brazile, who made very racist remarks about General Powell
  and about Congressman J.C. Watts. I believe, and I think you believe, and I hope
  we can get our colleagues here tonight together to ask Al Gore to fire Donna Brazile
  and to apologize to two great Americans, J.C. Watts and General Powell. Will you
  join me in that? [applause]

  Bauer: Steve, Steve, you are absolutely right. Let me just say to the good people
  in this audience, you have watched for 10 years while the Democratic Party has attempted
  to smear our party with charges of racism, with charges of not caring about the
  poor, with all sorts of scare tactics — that we don't care about the weak and the
  sick and the handicapped. They do it time and time and time again. And all too often
  our party in the face of that has run for the tall grass. It is time for us to stand
  up. We are a party of great principles. Al Gore's campaign manager ought to be ashamed
  of herself, and she ought to resign tonight. [applause]

  Stanton: Mr. Bauer, thank you.

  Williams: We'd like now to enter a brief phase of short questions and rapid-fire
  answers — gentlemen, if you could, answers of one to two seconds in length. [laughter]
  We will begin with Senator — one to two sentences. We will settle for one to two
  sentences in length if you must. Senator McCain, you will begin. All gentlemen will
  answer this first question: Has affirmative action made America a better nation?

  McCain: Yes, but quotas have made it worse.

  Williams: Gary Bauer.

  Bauer: Oh, you mean the same question?

  Williams: Yes.

  Bauer: I would agree. I think that the idea behind affirmative action was legitimate
  and decent, that when you start counting by race you divide America, you don't bring
  it together.

  Williams: Governor Bush?

  Bush: Only if affirmative action means equal opportunity for everybody. [applause]

  Williams: Mr. Forbes?

  Forbes: Quotas and set-asides are wrong. That's why we genuinely need real affirmation
  of opportunity starting by letting parents choose their own schools for their own
  children. [applause]

  Williams: Senator Hatch?

  Hatch: When affirmative action means job training, outreach and education, it's
  good. When it starts pitting one group against another through a system of preferences
  it's bad. And I've got to tell you quotas are wrong for America, and I agree: equal
  opportunity is what we should have for everybody. [applause]

  Williams: Ambassador Keyes?

  Keyes: I think it may be more important to ask whether it's helped the people it
  was supposed to help. And I think that it has actually hurt them by damaging the
  reputation of many minorities in this country and not giving them credit for their
  real achievements, and I think that's wrong. [applause]

  Stanton: We have another short-answer question. South Carolinians are going to be
  voting on a state lottery later this year. A national gambling commission has recommended
  no further state lotteries — a moratorium on them for the time being. Do you agree
  with that, Mr. Bauer?

  Bauer: Yes, I do agree with it. I not only agree with that — I think the gambling
  industry is corrupting our culture, corrupting our families, and will eventually
  corrupt politics with the unregulated money. [applause]

  Stanton: Governor Bush, same question.

  Bush: I've got a strong anti-gambling record in my state of Texas. But let me say
  something: just like the flag, the people of South Carolina can figure out whether
  or not they want to have a lottery or not. That's the people of South Carolina's
  decision to make. [applause]

  Stanton: Mr. Forbes?

  Forbes: When the gambling issue came up in my home state of New Jersey more than
  20 years ago, I voted against it every time it came up. So I would urge you not
  to think that gambling money is going to provide you with a better education. It's
  a false steal. [applause] Stanton: Senator Hatch.

  Hatch: Yes, yes, yes and yes. [laughs] I have to say that South Carolina has got
  to determine its own destiny, and I would certainly support that.

  Stanton: Ambassador?

  Keyes: I think it's very important that we leave these decisions up to the states.
  But if you solicit my advice, I'll tell you this: all governments everywhere — federal,
  state, local — should get out of the business of putting a corrupting, regressive
  tax on the backs of their people! [applause]

  Stanton: Senator McCain.

  McCain: I believe the people of South Carolina made a very wise decision when they
  rejected video poker in their state. It was very harmful — [applause] — it was very
  harmful and very addictive.

  The problem with these lotteries is that the poor people are the ones who buy the
  lottery tickets, and it is a very regressive tax. But I would leave the decision
  up to the people of South Carolina —

  Stanton: Thank you.

  McCain: — and I will respect and admire their decision.

  Stanton: Thank you. Also tonight we're going to be taking questions from our audience.
  And we will begin with a Greenville County farmer, Grady Jones. Mr. Jones?

  Q: I'll address my question to all of you gentlemen. I am a farmer. Most farmers
  would rather get adequate pay at the marketplace instead of receiving government
  subsidies to tide them over. Farmers now get paid in most cases less than they got
  25 years ago. During this time their production costs have at least quadrupled.
  What will you do as president to help farmers get sufficient pay for their work?

  Stanton: Governor Bush?

  Bush: I would be a free-trading president, a president that will work tirelessly
  to open up markets for agricultural products all over the world. I believe our American
  farmers, whether they be the South Carolinian farmer or the Iowan farmer or the
  Texas rancher, can compete so long as the playing field is level. That's why I am
  such a strong advocate of free trade, and that's why I reject protectionism and
  isolationism, because I think it hurts our American farmers. [applause]

  Stanton: Mr. Forbes.

  Forbes: Clearly — clearly the Clinton-Gore administration has made a hash of farm
  policies as they have everything else. There are several things that have to be
  done. One is to open up foreign markets — bust them open — they've talked about
  it, they haven't done it. Number two, stop hurting our existing customers overseas
  for our farm products and other products, by having the International Monetary Fund
  and Treasury Department wreck economies by giving them high taxes and trashing their
  money. We also must get the Federal Reserve on a steady monetary policy instead
  of raising interest rates, which damages, several damages commodity prices — it
  happened 15 years ago. We must also enforce antitrust laws, integration in the farm
  sector, in the food sector. All of these things and others I think would help revive
  the farmers in America. [applause]

  Stanton: Thank you, sir. Senator Hatch.

  Hatch: I am a strong proponent of Freedom to Farm, but with a safety net. We have
  to make a transition there — have to support the $8.7 billion emergency farm bill.
  We have the Hatch-Daschle bill that would allow state-inspected meats to be sold
  throughout the country like foreign meats can be sold. We spent nine percent of
  our income on food, the lowest in the world. We spend — or should I say 90 days
  to pay on food — nine percent. It takes 129 days to pay for our taxes. Think about
  it: it's a lot more than our food. I think we have got to do everything we can about
  vertical and horizontal integration in the antitrust field, and of course I'd do
  everything to push foreign markets all over the world as president.

  Stanton: Ambassador Keyes?

  Keyes: I think it's very critical, first of all, that we recognize that we have
  to give our farmers access to the kind of capital that they need in order to deal
  with the challenges that they face in their marketplace, a banking system that is
  not sensitive to the needs of agriculture is what is destroying the family farm,
  and we need to change that.

  But I would have to disagree with Governor Bush. If you want access to markets abroad,
  then don't practice this phony free-trade approach. We need to get out of this collective
  business of bargaining and sit down and make these countries understand if they
  want access to our markets, they are going to have to give us in exchange something
  that is of equal value. And the collectivist approach we have been taking hasn't
  produced that result. [applause]

  Stanton: Senator McCain.

  McCain: The American farmer is the most productive and efficient farmer in the world.
  He or she can compete anywhere in the world as long as we open the markets to those
  products. Isolationism and protectionism doesn't work. We should not subsidize ethanol
  or sugar or any other crop, because then that hurts the American consumer. But I
  will lower the barriers to United States products coming in the United States in
  return for any nation that will lower their barriers to United States products,
  particularly our magnificent and wonderful agricultural products. I am proud of
  the American farmer. Our trade with Canada has increased, our trade with Mexico
  has increased, and our farmers have benefited from it. And I believe that one of
  our jobs is to protect the family farmer in America. And this is the best way to
  do it. [applause]

  Stanton: Mr. Bauer?

  Bauer: I will enforce the antitrust laws of this country. If we ever wake up and
  our food supply is controlled by a handful of companies and the family farm is dead,
  we will regret that for the rest of our history.

  Free trade is fine, but we don't have free trade. For 10 years in a row we have
  given China most-favored-nation status, and in exchange they have stuck their finger
  in our eye. They buy less of our farm products now than they did in the past. Governor
  Bush and many others up here would give China most-favored-nation status again.
  I will not. I will withdraw it the first week in office. [applause and cheers]

  Stanton: Mr. Bauer, thank you.

  Williams: Mr. Bauer, thank you. Now Senator Hatch has a question for Ambassador
  Keyes.

  Hatch: Ambassador Keyes, what is missing from these debates, it seems to me, is
  a very substantive discussion of what really America needs: What are we going to
  do to — we have been discussing a limited handful of issues through these various
  debates, and we better begin talking about the problems that are troubling Americans:
  safety of our homes, our families, our schools, our country. And I would like to
  know what you think we ought to be doing in this area.

  Keyes: Well, I thank you for the question, Senator Hatch. I think that is quite
  clear. And I said it over and over again everywhere I go. I believe especially as
  Republicans we better face the fact we don't have a major economic crisis, we don't
  have a major international crisis. We have a moral crisis that is claiming the lives
  of our children — in the schools and in the streets — [applause] — and in the neighborhoods.
  And we must address that crisis as a matter of top priority. And I don't care who
  doesn't want to hear it. That means that the number one issue facing this country
  is the issue that takes us away from the principle that God gave us our rights,
  and those rights have to be exercised with respect for him. That issue is abortion,
  and we better address it forthrightly, up front, or we won't deserve to win. [applause
  and cheers]

  Stanton: Thank you, ambassador. We're taking another email now — a Columbia minister,
  the Reverend Eric Skidmore, sent us this: "What percentage of your annual income
  do you share with charitable causes? And how does your household decide how much
  you will share with those in need each year?" And a viewer called and asked, "Would
  you be willing to release your income tax returns for the past five years to show
  us how much?" And we begin with Mr. Forbes. [laughter]

  Forbes: Well, I just released tax information a few days ago, releasing my income
  taxes paid and contributions made to charity. I believe it's about 7 to 8 percent
  of the income goes to charity each year, and I'm proud of it and I hope to do more
  in the future. So I have released the information.

  I think one of the great strengths of America today is the willingness of the American
  people to give. No other nation does it the way we do, and that's why I want to
  get rid of this corrupt tax code, allow the American people to genuinely keep more
  of what they earn. And that way, when they have more, they give more. With my tax
  plan, they'll have more and there'll be more charitable giving. [applause]

  Stanton: Senator Hatch.

  Hatch: The answer is yes. And I have to say that Elaine and I try to — as I said
  before, I can't even lift Steve's wallet. But the fact of the matter is, Elaine
  and I give about 11 percent of our gross income to charity, and we're going to continue
  to do that because we think it's the right thing to do in this country. And as far
  as I'm concerned, we don't have anything to hide, if people want to see what we
  make, to understand how really poor we are. [laughter]

  Stanton: Ambassador Keyes.

  Keyes: The answer to the question — I really don't know what percentage we give.
  Two things are true, though. I have no problem with folks knowing how little, in
  point of fact, I make in the way of income. I do have a problem, though, with the
  whole assumption we have in this society, based on our income tax system, that it
  is, in fact, legitimate to invade the privacy of individuals or anybody else.

  I think the income tax system has utterly corrupted our sense of liberty, and that's
  why I think it ought to be abolished. [applause] And such returns should not have
  to be given or exposed to anybody — not mine, not yours, not anyone's. But I believe,
  in addition to that, that the whole business of the tax deduction corrupts the spirit
  of charity. And that's also why we need to get rid of the income tax so we will
  really give freely, not out of any selfish interest. [applause]

  Stanton: Senator McCain.

  McCain: Several years ago, Congress enacted a pay raise, and my constituents didn't
  think we needed it. I don't know if that was a personal view or of Congress in general.
  Ever since then, I've been giving my pay raises to charity, and I think that comes
  out to around $30,000, $30,000 or $40,000. Cindy also and I have a very large charitable
  trust.

  But, you know, I'm not here to hype my book, "Faith of My Fathers," $24.95, Random
  House; been on the best-seller list for four months. I'm not here to hype that at
  all, because I wouldn't even mention it except it had the most remote connection,
  and that is that I got $500,000 advance from Random House. I gave my half of that,
  which I shared with my co-author, to charity. And I continue to give those proceeds
  to charity. [applause]

  Stanton: Mr. Bauer.

  Bauer: I just — before I answer the question, I'd like to get a pledge from you
  that if you're involved in a Democratic debate, to be sure to ask Al Gore this question.
  [applause and laughter]

  Stanton: Mr. Bauer, I can assure you, if we're involved in the Democratic debate,
  we will ask the vice president that question.

  Bauer: My background is Southern Baptist. My wife and I are in a non-denominational
  church right now. We take very seriously the biblical call to tithe. We give about
  10 percent of our income every year. And my flat-tax plan, by the way, continues
  to allow charitable contributions to be tax-deductible, unlike Mr. Forbes, which
  I think is a very important thing for us to do.

  Stanton: Governor Bush.

  Bush: I think it's important for people in public life to reveal their income tax
  returns. I have done so ever since I've been the governor of the state of Texas.
  Laura and I try to contribute as generously as possible. I'm not sure of the percentage
  to which we have given to charities. I believe non-itemizers ought to be allowed
  to deduct charitable giving from their returns.

  Let me tell you, the great strength of America and why I'm so optimistic about our
  country's future is that the great strength of our country lies in the hearts and
  souls of decent citizens, not in the halls of government. I intend to rally the
  armies of compassion all across America, should I become the president, to help
  people in need with people... [applause]

  Williams: Thank you, Governor Bush. Ambassador Keyes, it is your turn to ask a question
  of Senator McCain.

  Keyes: Senator McCain, yesterday we got into a discussion of the question of homosexuals
  in the military. And I wasn't quite sure that everyone understood exactly what your
  position was. I have signed the following pledge: "In the interest of national security
  and the morale of our armed forces, if elected president of the United States, I
  pledge to reinstitute the ban on homosexuals serving in our nation's military."
  [applause] Would you join me — would you join me, sir, in signing that pledge?

  McCain: No, I will not, Alan. And you know very well that when people like General
  Colin Powell, General Norman Schwarzkopf, and the military leaders that you and
  I respect say that this policy is a good one — by the way, it should not be abandoned,
  as the two leading presidential candidates on the Democratic — it's a disgraceful
  statement on the part of Senator Bradley and Vice President Gore to say that they
  would only appoint a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who would accept gays
  in the military. That is a total destruction of the entire concept of the military.
  And we should, as Americans, reject such a thing because of the harmful effects
  it will have on the military of the United States of America. No, I will not. I
  will support the present policy. [applause]

  Williams: And so we continue, well, I think with a few exceptions perhaps, from
  Columbia, South Carolina tonight. We're going to take a break. Our coverage of our
  debate this evening, part of Decision 2000, will continue right after this.

  [television break]

  Williams: And welcome back. On behalf of NBC News, MSNBC and WIS Television in Columbia,
  South Carolina, this is our live coverage of this evening's debate among the six
  presidential candidates for the GOP nomination for president. We are back. David
  Stanton will continue the questioning.

  Stanton: And the next question is a question from Mr. Bauer to ask of Governor Bush.

  Bauer: Yes. Thank you very much. Governor Bush, this is the fourth time in a row
  that I've drawn your name to ask the first question to. I think the odds are 10,000
  to one. I think I'm going to keep drawing your name until you actually answer the
  question. [laughter]

  Bush: Starting off with an incredible cheap shot.

  Bauer: Governor, just a few weeks ago, we transferred the Panama Canal back to Panama.
  Bill Clinton sent Jimmy Carter there to do it. I believe our national security is
  at stake in Panama. We've got a growing Chinese influence there. They've got the
  land on both ends of the canal. If I'm president, I'm going to look at how I can
  reassert American military forces there. Are you willing to take the steps necessary,
  including putting our military back in Panama, in order to stop the Chinese from
  taking over influence there?

  Bush: Here's what I'm willing to do.

  Bauer: Okay.

  Bush: First, I ran for the United States Congress in 1978 in West Texas, came in
  second place in a two-man race. [laughter] But during the course of the campaign,
  I opposed the Panama Canal Treaty. Now, our country has signed a treaty. I believe
  we ought to honor the treaty. But when I'm the president, if I find in any way,
  shape or form the canal is closed to world interests, I will do whatever it takes
  to keep the canal open. It is in our national strategic interest to have a peaceful
  hemisphere. It is in our national strategic interest to have a hemisphere in which
  trade can flow freely. And I will liberate the canal if I have to.

  Bauer: Do you see a threat from China in the canal, sir?

  Bush: Well, we'll just wait and see. We'll wait and see.

  Williams: Gentlemen, thank you. Again, this question will be for all of you. And
  we are also joined tonight by reporter Stephanie Trotter of our NBC television station
  in Greenville, South Carolina, WYFF.

  Trotter: Thank you, Brian. Gentlemen, I'm curious. As an adult, what is the biggest
  mistake that you've made, and what lesson did you learn from it?

  Hatch: Say it again. Have her say it again.

  Trotter: One more time, so everybody can hear. Our viewers are curious. On a personal
  note, what is the biggest mistake you made as an adult, and what lesson did you
  learn from it?

  Bush: Would you like me to start?

  Williams: No, we're going to begin with Senator Hatch.

  Hatch: I don't know what the question is. I couldn't quite understand it.

  Williams: The question is — if we could have Stephanie Trotter repeat the question
  one more time on the microphone.

  Trotter: Our viewers would like to know, what is the biggest mistake you made as
  an adult, and what lesson did you learn from it?

  Hatch: Well, I've made so many of them in my life that I'm not sure I can pick any
  one of them. [applause] I mean, let's just face it. I've made a lot of mistakes.
  I think one of the mistakes in this campaign was filing on July 1st, so late. But
  don't worry; don't count me out.

  Williams: Ambassador Keyes, same question.

  Keyes: In hearing that question, I think about the biggest mistake I might make
  as an adult would be to treat that as if it's a question that is appropriate to
  be asked. [applause and cheers]

  Trotter: [inaudible]

  Keyes: And I say that quite frankly. I think that we have to understand that there
  ought to be in our public life a certain decorum, a certain dignity. There are things
  that I'll tell my priest in the confessional that I will not tell you or any other
  American. [cheers]

  Williams: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

  Keyes: But I'll say this. I'll say this. In terms of what I deeply believe to be
  relevant for the purposes of running for president and the job that I would have
  to do for the American people and so forth and so on, I think that maybe the biggest
  mistake I have made in my public life, before I got involved in this presidential
  race, was not to have spoken out on the issue of the life of the unborn before I
  did.

  Williams: Mr. Ambassador —

  Keyes: I spent all those years working on foreign policy and did not pay enough
  attention to the fact —

  Williams: Mr. Ambassador, thank you —

  Keyes: — that there were those not championing this issue.

  Williams: Thank you for your answer.

  Keyes: And I'm glad I finally came forward on it.

  Williams: Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your answer. [applause] Senator McCain.

  McCain: Well, for a long time, I thought the biggest mistake I made in my life might
  have been when I was sitting in the ready room of an aircraft carrier in the Philippines
  and a guy came on board and said, "We're looking for volunteers to switch over to
  another carrier." [laughter] Something happened to my arm.

  But in reality, the biggest mistake that I made in my life was attending a meeting
  with four other senators and four regulators because of the appearance of impropriety.
  It's something that will always be a mark on my record and something that people
  will judge me for for the rest of my life.

  Williams: Senator McCain, thank you. [applause] Mr. Bauer.

  Bauer: Well, I just want to point out to you, ma'am, that if you asked the president
  of the United States that question, it would be an essay answer. [cheers] I'm not
  going to tell you the greatest personal mistake I've ever made, because it is personal,
  but I'll tell you the biggest political mistake I ever made.

  I made a presentation to the president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, in the
  Cabinet Room, and I made the mistake of citing to him a poll. And his face turned
  blood-red and he pointed his finger at me and he said, "Gary, don't cite polls.
  Tell me the best thing to do for America." I've never forgotten those words, and
  those words will carry us back into the White House. [applause]

  Williams: Mr. Bauer, thank you. Governor Bush.

  Bush: Well, as you know, I've had a perfect background. [applause]

  Williams: Haven't we all, sir?

  Bush: After all, I was raised by Barbara Bush. [laughter and applause] As you may
  remember, I was in the business world at one time. I was the managing partner, managing
  general partner of the mighty Texas Rangers. I signed off on that wonderful transaction
  — Sammy Sosa for Harold Baines. [laughter]

  Williams: Thank you, Governor. Mr. Forbes.

  Forbes: Well, like my colleagues here tonight, I've made my share of personal mistakes.
  And fortunately, none of us here tonight, put together, will match what has been
  done in the White House in the last seven and a half years. [cheers and applause]

  But on a professional basis, when I was young and inexperienced, I wrote some magazine
  columns in which, when I was in my 20s, I saw merit in things like raising the gasoline
  tax, raising the age for Social Security retirees, and things like that. But I've
  learned and grown. That's why I have the positions I have today. And I hope the
  rest of my colleagues in the Republican Party will have the same growth. [applause]

  Stanton: Thank you, Mr. Forbes. And now we're going to pair the candidates off to
  discuss particular issues. We begin with Ambassador Keyes and Mr. Forbes. And the
  issue is negative advertising. Are you concerned that if you have negative advertising
  towards each other in the Republican primaries that that will hurt the eventual
  nominee in the general election? Ambassador Keyes.

  Keyes: Well, two things. First of all, I myself don't believe in any form of kind
  of negative campaigning. I think that it's important, however, that we be honest
  and forthright about our differences on the issues. That is not negative campaigning.
  That's our obligation to the people of this country. And so if I disagree with Senator
  McCain or Governor Bush or Mr. Forbes or Gary Bauer or Senator Hatch on an important
  issue and point that out in an ad or anywhere else, that's not negative campaigning.
  It's an effort to illustrate the choice before the people.

  But if we turn it into a contest of personalities and snide remarks and efforts
  to make the American people think that there's something wrong at a personal level
  with others in the race, I think that shows a lack of respect for each other and
  for the process, and we shouldn't so degrade it. [applause]

  Stanton: Mr. Forbes.

  Forbes: Mine has always been a campaign of issues and ideas. I believe that the
  American people want an honest, open and vigorous debate about issues. One of the
  issues, for example, is taxation. I want to get rid of this tax code. A couple of
  my opponents do not. I think we need a vigorous and open debate on that in detail.
  If you make a tax pledge, I believe you should keep it. I want that kind of honest
  and vigorous debate.

  And I think Alan is exactly right. We don't want to get into personalities. We do
  want to get into principle and substance. That is what we had in the Lincoln-Douglas
  debates. That is what we had with the debate
